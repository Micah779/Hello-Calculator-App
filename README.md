Hello Calculator App ðŸ“±

    This is my fun side project to create a Hello Kitty inspired calculator app using Swift. I'm building this as a gift for my girlfriend who loves all things Hello Kitty! ðŸ’•

    Even though I'm new to Swift, I'm learning as I go using tutorials and documentation. This is my first Swift project, so it's a great way to get hands-on experience with the language.

Features

    Cute Hello Kitty theme with pink background and icons
    
    Basic calculator functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
    
    Memory functions to store previous calculations
    
    Animations and sound effects for extra fun
    
Getting Started
    
    Feel free to clone the repo and play around with the code! I'll continue to add features and improvements over time.

To run the app on your local machine:

    Clone the repo
    
    Open the project in Xcode

    Build and run the app on your simulator or connected device

Learnings
